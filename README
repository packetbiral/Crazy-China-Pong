This is a pong game in Python, made by SmartViking.

Packages required to play (*nix users):
python 2.x (NOTE - Python 3 users, use python2 Crazy_China_Pong.py to play)
python-pygame.

WINDOWS USERS:
If you don't already have Python installed, get the Windows binary here (get the 32-bit even if you have 64-bit Windows) - http://www.python.org/getit/
After you have installed Python, get the pygame Windows binary here - http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

Tested with python 2.6 and pygame 1.8.1
Does NOT work with Python 3.

        TODO:
    * A highscore, have a file which stores the scores and maybe have some default ones.
    * Some type of powerups, I'm thinking simple but effective. 
               - Maybe simply an increase in score for catching an object with the gun. 
               - UPDATE: Kinda did this, works nicely.
