This is a pong game in Python, made by SmartViking.

Packages required to play:
python 2.x (NOTE - Python 3 users, use python2 Crazy_China_Pong.py to play)
python-pygame.

Tested with python 2.6 and pygame 1.8.1

        TODO:
    * A highscore, have a file which stores the scores and maybe have some default ones.
    * Some type of powerups, I'm thinking simple but effective. Maybe simply an increase in score for catching an object with the gun. UPDATE: Kinda did this, works nicely.
