TODO:
    * Some type of powerups, I'm thinking simple but effective. 
    * Fix increasing RAM usage with each new game
 
KNOWN ISSUES:
    * RAM can get as high as 200+ MB by game 100

Command line arguments:
    * --novideo          : Start the game without the intro video.
    * --version/-v       : Show version number.
    * --credits          : Credits.
    * --debug/-d         : Enable debugging mode.
    * --bug/-b           : Disable debugging mode.
    * --fullscreen/-f    : Play in fullscreen(well almost).
